In this projec you will be creating a game that can be played on the command line. You pick the game. It can either be a game you made up
or a game that already exists. You will submit the link to your github repository for grading (make sure the repository is public).

Your game should print instructions at the beginning. (These instructions are important and should be clear) Points will be deducted for 
inconsistancies between the game and the instructions. Everything should work like the instructions say and the game should never crash. 
If your game follows your instructions and never crashes you will recieve full credit. Extra points may be given for creativity or if you 
created a new game.

There will be no skeleton code for this project because of the many different types of games you could create.
